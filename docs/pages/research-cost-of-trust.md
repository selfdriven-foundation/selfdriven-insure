# The Rising Cost of Trust in the Age of AI  
## Why insurance must redesign trust itself

---

## Summary

AI makes information cheap and verification expensive.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and KERI-based mechanisms allow insurers to shift from human-mediated trust to cryptographic proof — turning trust into reusable infrastructure.

---

## The Hidden Cost

For decades, insurance has quietly absorbed the **Cost of Establishing Trust**.

It appears everywhere:

- Identity verification  
- Claims assessment  
- Fraud detection  
- Compliance reporting  
- Manual reviews  
- Third‑party checks  
- Expert opinions  

AI now threatens to multiply these costs by making synthetic evidence trivial to generate.

## The AI Paradox

> The cheaper it becomes to generate information,  
> the more expensive it becomes to verify it.

Fraud scales.  
Synthetic identities multiply.  
Operational friction rises.

Without structural change, insurers face:

- Slower claims handling  
- Ballooning operating costs  
- Rising customer friction  
- Eroding margins  

AI doesn’t reduce trust costs.

It accelerates them.

## Today’s Model: Trust After the Fact

Most insurers still:

1. Collect data  
2. Store centrally  
3. Verify later  
4. Resolve disputes manually  

Every claim becomes an investigation.

Trust is applied *after* events occur.

## The Shift: Trust at the Point of Creation

SSI and KERI introduce:

- Cryptographic identities  
- Signed events at creation  
- Independently verifiable credentials  
- Tamper‑evident histories  
- Machine‑verifiable provenance  

Simply put:

**Proof replaces process.**

Every interaction carries cryptographic evidence:

- Who created it  
- When it happened  
- What was asserted  
- What was authorized  

No PDFs.  
No screenshots.  
No upload portals.

Just verifiable facts.

## What Changes for Insurance

With KERI + SSI:

- Claims become cryptographic events  
- Policies become living credentials  
- Risk signals arrive pre‑verified  
- Compliance becomes continuous  
- AI agents operate safely on proofs  

You stop paying repeatedly to rediscover trust.

You establish it once — at the edge — and reuse it everywhere.

---

## Economic Impact

Instead of rising trust costs:

- Manual reviews fall  
- Fraud exposure drops  
- Automation becomes safer  
- Data pipelines become cleaner  
- Compliance overhead shrinks  

Trust becomes infrastructure.

Not labour.  
Not paperwork.  
Not bureaucracy.

---

## Bottom Line

AI guarantees one thing:

**The cost of establishing trust will rise dramatically.**

Unless insurers move from:

Human-mediated verification  
to  
Cryptographic, machine-verifiable proof

KERI-based SSI doesn’t just reduce fraud.

It restructures insurance economics.

It turns trust from an operating expense  
into a reusable asset.

In the age of AI, that shift may define the future of insurance.
