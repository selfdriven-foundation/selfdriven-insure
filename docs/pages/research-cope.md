# Residential Home COPE – Risk Scoring Template

This template is designed for engineering, insurance, underwriting, council, or owner self-assessment use.

## Scoring Method
- Score each factor **1–5**
- **1 = Low risk / Best practice**
- **5 = High risk / Poor or non-compliant**
- Weighting optional (noted below)

---

## C — Construction (Weight: 30%)

| Factor | 1 | 3 | 5 | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary structure | Reinforced concrete / masonry | Mixed materials | Lightweight untreated timber |  |
| Roof type & condition | Metal/tile <10 yrs, compliant | 10–25 yrs, minor defects | >25 yrs, poor condition |  |
| Fire resistance | Rated assemblies, AS 3959 compliant | Partial protection | No fire-rated elements |  |
| Build quality | Certified, QA records | Minor defects | Known structural issues |  |
| Maintenance status | Proactive & documented | Reactive | Deferred / neglected |  |
| Security (physical) | Reinforced doors/windows | Standard locks | Minimal security |  |

**Construction Sub-Score (avg):** ___ / 5

---

## O — Occupancy (Weight: 20%)

| Factor | 1 | 3 | 5 | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Use type | Owner-occupied | Long-term rental | Holiday / vacant |  |
| Occupancy pattern | Permanent | Intermittent | Unoccupied long periods |  |
| Occupant load | Appropriate | Slightly high | Overcrowded |  |
| Supervision | Daily presence | Weekly | Rare / none |  |

**Occupancy Sub-Score (avg):** ___ / 5

---

## P — Protection (Weight: 30%)

| Factor | 1 | 3 | 5 | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smoke detection | Interlinked, AS 3786 | Battery only | None / non-working |  |
| Fire suppression | Extinguishers + water | Partial | None |  |
| Security systems | Monitored alarm + CCTV | Local alarm | None |  |
| Water supply | Dedicated + pressure | Mains only | Limited |  |
| Emergency access | Excellent | Moderate | Poor |  |
| Proximity to services | <5 min | 5–15 min | >15 min |  |

**Protection Sub-Score (avg):** ___ / 5

---

## E — Environment (Weight: 20%)

| Factor | 1 | 3 | 5 | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bushfire exposure | BAL-LOW | BAL-19/29 | BAL-40/FZ |  |
| Flood risk | Outside zone | Low probability | Flood overlay |  |
| Wind zone | Low | Medium | High / cyclone |  |
| Hazardous industry | None nearby | Moderate | Close proximity |  |
| Crime zone | Low | Average | High |  |

**Environment Sub-Score (avg):** ___ / 5

## Overall COPE Risk Score

### Weighted Total Formula (example)

Total Risk =
(C × 0.30) +
(O × 0.20) +
(P × 0.30) +
(E × 0.20)

### Interpretation
- **1.0 – 2.0:** Low risk / resilient
- **2.1 – 3.0:** Moderate risk
- **3.1 – 4.0:** High risk – mitigation recommended
- **4.1 – 5.0:** Critical risk – action required
