# Board, AFCA, and Standards Alignment  
## Proof-Based Insurance (Board-Ready)

Below is a **board-ready translation**, followed by a **direct AFCA mapping**, and then a **standards alignment**.  
Each section is written so it can be lifted directly into a board paper or risk pack with minimal editing.

---

## 1. Board-Level Risk Translation  
### What This Means for Directors

### The Core Issue (Plain English)

The insurer’s current operating model relies on:
- documents,
- images,
- declarations,
- and human judgement.

These are no longer reliable in an AI-enabled environment.

This creates **non-linear risk exposure** that scales faster than existing controls.

---

### Key Board Risks Being Addressed

### 1. Operational Risk

**Current exposure**
- Manual claims handling  
- Inconsistent evidence quality  
- High exception rates  
- Staff-dependent decision quality  

**Proof-based impact**
- Deterministic verification replaces interpretation  
- Automation applies only where evidence is verifiable  
- Exceptions are explicitly identified, not discovered late  

**Board takeaway**

Lower loss volatility and fewer operational failures at scale.

---

### 2. Conduct & Fairness Risk

**Current exposure**
- Disputes over “what evidence means”  
- Perceived inconsistency in claims outcomes  
- Customer complaints driven by opacity  

**Proof-based impact**
- Decisions are explainable by verification steps  
- The same evidence produces the same outcome  
- Appeals focus on missing or invalid proofs, not opinion  

**Board takeaway**

Reduced conduct risk and improved defensibility of decisions.

---

### 3. Regulatory & Supervisory Risk

**Current exposure**
- Difficulty reconstructing decisions  
- Heavy reliance on staff testimony  
- Model governance reviews are time-consuming  

**Proof-based impact**
- Every decision is reproducible  
- Evidence provenance is explicit  
- Supervisors can independently verify inputs  

**Board takeaway**

Stronger supervisory confidence and lower regulatory friction.

---

### 4. Fraud & Leakage Risk

**Current exposure**
- Synthetic documents and images  
- Post-payment fraud detection  
- Increasing loss-adjustment costs  

**Proof-based impact**
- Fraud prevented at submission, not detected later  
- Invalid proofs fail automatically  
- Reduced incentive for low-effort fraud attempts  

**Board takeaway**

Structural reduction in fraud, not just better detection.

---

### 5. Strategic Risk (AI Adoption)

**Current exposure**
- AI adoption constrained by trust concerns  
- Risk of “black box” decision-making  
- Fear of regulatory pushback  

**Proof-based impact**
- AI verifies, not decides  
- Clear human accountability remains  
- Automation aligned with regulator expectations  

**Board takeaway**

Enables safe AI adoption without reputational or regulatory backlash.

---

### One-Line Board Framing (Reusable)

> This shifts insurance from judgement-based processing to verification-based control, reducing loss volatility, dispute rates, and regulatory risk while enabling safe automation.

---

## 2. Mapping to AFCA Dispute Reduction

### Why AFCA Complaints Happen Today

Most AFCA insurance disputes arise from:
- evidence authenticity,
- interpretation differences,
- delayed claims handling,
- unclear reasons for denial,
- inconsistent outcomes.

These are **process problems**, not product problems.

---

### Proof-Based Impact on AFCA Drivers

#### Evidence Authenticity

**Today**
- “The photo doesn’t prove damage.”  
- “The document may not be valid.”  

**With proofs**
- Evidence is issuer-signed and time-bound  
- Authenticity is objective  

**AFCA impact**

Fewer disputes about whether evidence is “real”.

---

#### Interpretation Disputes

**Today**
- Different assessors reach different conclusions  
- Customers feel treated unfairly  

**With proofs**
- Verification rules are consistent  
- Outcomes are deterministic  

**AFCA impact**

Reduced inconsistency-based complaints.

---

#### Delays & Process Failures

**Today**
- Back-and-forth requests for documents  
- Long review cycles  

**With proofs**
- Verification is immediate  
- Missing proofs are identified upfront  

**AFCA impact**

Faster resolution and fewer “delay” complaints.

---

#### Poor Explanations

**Today**
- “Based on our assessment…”  
- Difficult to explain decisions clearly  

**With proofs**
- “These verifications passed / failed.”  
- Clear, auditable rationale  

**AFCA impact**

Stronger explanations and higher acceptance of outcomes.

---

### Summary AFCA Positioning

Proof-based claims handling addresses the **root causes of disputes**, rather than managing them after escalation.

This directly supports:
- reduced AFCA volumes,  
- lower remediation costs,  
- improved complaint metrics.

---

## 3. Alignment to Australian Standards & NCC

This is where proofs become **regulator-grade evidence**.

---

### NCC (National Construction Code)

**Current practice**
- Compliance asserted via certificates and PDFs  
- Difficult to validate post-construction  

**Proof-based alignment**
- NCC compliance issued as a Construction VC  
- References specific NCC clauses  
- Signed by an accredited certifier  
- Time-bound to construction or renovation events  

**Underwriting benefit**

Construction risk is verifiable, not inferred.

---

### AS 3959 — Construction in Bushfire-Prone Areas

**Current practice**
- BAL ratings declared or documented  
- Often outdated or disputed at claim time  

**Proof-based alignment**
- BAL assessment issued as a VC  
- Includes:
  - BAL rating  
  - Assessor identity  
  - Assessment date  
- Re-issuance required on renovation  

**Claims benefit**

Eliminates disputes about bushfire compliance.

---

### AS 1851 — Maintenance of Fire Protection Systems

**Current practice**
- Invoices or maintenance logs  
- Difficult to verify ongoing compliance  

**Proof-based alignment**
- Maintenance events issued as Protection VCs  
- Include:
  - System type  
  - Test outcome  
  - Validity period  

**Risk benefit**

Protection risk is continuously verifiable.

---

### AS/NZS 1170 — Structural Design Actions

**Current practice**
- Design assumptions embedded in plans  
- Rarely referenced in underwriting  

**Proof-based alignment**
- Structural design parameters attested at build time  
- Available as underwriting inputs  

**Portfolio benefit**

Better catastrophe modelling inputs.

---

### Standards Summary Table

| Standard | Risk Area | Proof-Based Control |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| NCC | Construction compliance | Certifier-issued VC |
| AS 3959 | Bushfire risk | BAL rating VC |
| AS 1851 | Fire protection | Maintenance VCs |
| AS/NZS 1170 | Structural resilience | Design attestation |

---

## Final Executive Framing (Highly Reusable)

This approach aligns underwriting and claims directly to Australian standards, reduces disputes, strengthens prudential control, and enables automation without increasing conduct or regulatory risk.
